Description: Yet another Fisher's Exact tool, with some
    twists. Designed to address the issue of "multiple voting" in
    typical biological enrichment analyses. The package handles
    multiple mappings (for example, probesets mapping to multiple
    genes) in the discrete counting steps prior to calculating
    hypergeometric probabilities.
