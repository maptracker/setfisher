%% This is a silly matrix used for running tests, and for basic
%% demonstrations that can be manually checked due to the small sizes
%% of the dimensions involved. This matrix is intended to be used as a
%% "Query Matrix" in the SetFisher package.
%
%% DEFAULT Name Crime Scene Suspect Lists
%% DEFAULT Description Three recent crimes and the villains reported to have been there
%% DEFAULT ScoreDesc Number of witnesses reporting the villain present at the scene
% Rows are Crimes
%% DEFAULT RowDim Crime
% Columns are Villain Names
%% DEFAULT ColDim Villain
%
%% DEFAULT LoadComment Toy matrix with a few simple lists to use as the 'Query' in a SetFisherAnalysis object.
%
% Default Automatic Filters
% These parameters define filters that will be automatically applied when the
% matrix is loaded, unless you set autofilter=FALSE. You can also undo them by
% calling $reset() after loading
%
%% DEFAULT MinScore 2 ## Consider only cases where at least two witnesses identify a villain at a crime scene
