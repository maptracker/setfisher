\description{
Parses a List-of-Lists file so it can be read by AnnotatedMatrix
}
\details{
This method is somewhat slow; For many files, you may wish to use
the Perl script "listOfList_to_MatrixMarket.pl" script in the perl/
subdirectory of the AnnotatedMatrix installation.

Once the file is parsed, an RDS version will be written "next to"
it (same path, plus ".rds"), which will load rapidly, unless a
change to the original file triggers an automatic reparsing.
