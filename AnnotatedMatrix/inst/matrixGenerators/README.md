These files will utilize public data sources to generate MatrixMarket
files that can be read by AnnotatedMatrix. The generated matrix files
are not included in the installation because they are generally large,
and many variants can be produced. It is likely that most users will
not want all the files. The generators allow users to decide which
files to create.

* [hgncGeneSets.pl](hgncGeneSets.pl) - Downloads symbol and identifier
  information from http://www.genenames.org/ and makes both
  Symbol-Accession lookup maps as well as Accession-Accession maps.
* [pubMedExtractor.pl](pubMedExtractor.pl) - Creates a supporting
  SQLite database to provide dates and titles for the PubMed ontology
  generated by `entrezGeneSets.pl`. Bulk parses XML files from
  Medline.
* [entrezGeneSets.pl](entrezGeneSets.pl) - Downloads data from
  ftp.ncbi.nih.gov to make canonical mapping matrices for Entrez and
  RefSeq identifiers. Desirable to run `pubMedExtractor.pl` first in
  order to have PubMed metadata available.
